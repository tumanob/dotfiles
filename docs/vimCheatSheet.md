## Document Navigation

*hjkl* is used to navigate as arrows
h - left 
j - down
k - up
l - right 
Note: At first it was hard to get used to this layout as many years I used arrow keys but now I reprogramed my keyboard to navigate using this keys and it works so well. Still missing arrows sometimes but les and less evetyday.
